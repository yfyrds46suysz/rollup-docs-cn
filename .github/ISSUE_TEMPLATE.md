Issues without reproductions will be closed. To create a repro,

1. Use https://rollupjs.org/repl, or
2. Follow the instructions in https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/88c5fc2ac6dc941b22e7996af05d70ff

If you just require tech support, please avoid creating issues! Though we would love to help you, we have very limited resources. Answering support questions prevents us from fixing bugs and implementing new features. Instead

* search or post a question to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rollupjs
* ask for help on https://gitter.im/rollup/rollup
