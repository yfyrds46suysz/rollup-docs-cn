<!--
Thanks for raising an issue! To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:

* If you can demonstrate the bug using the interactive http://rollupjs.org demo, please do.
* If that's not possible, perhaps because your bug involves plugins, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.

Reproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org. For example, if your bug isn't related to Gulp, **do not include Gulp in the repro**. (Side-note: if it *is* related to Gulp, this is the wrong issue tracker!) If possible, use a config file as it's the standard, favoured approach to using Rollup: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Command-Line-Interface#using-a-config-file

Occasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Rollup is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and we will prioritise bugs that follow these instructions.

If you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:

<details>
  <summary>Stack trace</summary>
