# rollup changelog

## 0.7.1

* Named functions can be used as default exports from a bundle
* Method calls are assumed to mutate the owner (i.e. `foo.bar()` mutates `foo`) ([#13](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/13))
* `options.indent` can be used to control indentation of resulting bundle. `options.true` (default) means 'auto', `options.false` means empty string. Alternatively specify whitespace e.g. `'  '` or `'\t'` ([#5](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5))

## 0.7.0

* Ensure statements are always separated by a newline ([#9](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/9))
* Use CommonJS `exports` correctly (UMD exports)
* Throw error if `moduleName` is required but missing (UMD exports)
* Attach IIFE global to `this` rather than `window`
* Allow names inside bundle to the the names of `Object.prototype` properties ([#12](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/12))
* Keep exports live ([#11](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/11))

## 0.6.5

* Add sourceMappingURL comment to code, as appropriate
* Higher resolution sourcemaps

## 0.6.4

* Fix CJS bundling with default export

## 0.6.3

## 0.6.2

* Permit assignments to properties of imported bindings

## 0.6.1

* Support for basic transformers

## 0.6.0

* BREAKING - `rollup.rollup` and `bundle.write` both take a single options argument
* BREAKING - external modules must be declared upfront with `options.external: [...]`
* Non-relative module paths will be resolved by looking for `jsnext:main` fields in the appropriate `package.json` files. This behaviour can be overridden by passing an alternative `resolveExternal` function

* Rewrite computed property identifiers where necessary
* Preserve original statement order where possible
* Internal refactoring

## 0.3.1
