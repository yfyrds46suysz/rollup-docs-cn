## Quickstart

Rollup can be used via a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/JavaScript-API) or a [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Command-Line-Interface). Install with `npm install -g rollup` and run `rollup --help` to get started.

## A next-generation ES6 module bundler

When you're developing software, it's much easier to break your library or application apart into separate pieces that you can work on separately. It's also very likely that you'll have dependencies on third party libraries. The result is lots of small files â€“ but that's bad news for browsers, which get slowed down by having to make many requests.

The solution is to bundle your code into a single file that includes everything you need.
